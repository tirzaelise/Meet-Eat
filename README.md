On average, each person in The Netherlands throws away 135 kilograms of food each year. Meet & Eat will help reduce the amount of food that is thrown away and allow users to meet new people over dinner. This is done by letting users join each other's dinners. A dinner can be added to the Meet & Eat database by searching for a recipe, giving up how many people can join the dinner, the city where the dinner will be held and the time and date of the dinner. Once the desired recipe has been chosen, other users can join the added dinner. Users of Meet & Eat can also view the dinners that they have joined so that they can easily keep track of where they have to be. Users can see the dinners they're hosting as well.
