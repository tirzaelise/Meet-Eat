# Process book

#### Day 1
Wrote my application proposal.

#### Day 2
Wrote my design document and started creating the layouts of the different activities.

#### Day 3
Started writing code: Google authentication using Firebase.

#### Day 4
Can now read from Firebase database and write to Firebase database.

#### Day 5
Gave presentation and started working on navigation drawer. Will have to figure out how Fragments work next week. (Worked on Fragments during the weekend to improve app design, might have to drop Google login and work with email verification instead because it does not work well with fragments)
